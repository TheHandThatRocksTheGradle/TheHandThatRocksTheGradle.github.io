## WARNING - this is a Ramble

So this is my first blog post using the [Jekyll][jekyll] blog, and my first forray into [Github][github]. I am really not sure where I am going with this but it looked like a fun project and I want a place to refer back to as I make my way though my online courses, and to have a place to vent frustrations as I hammer my way through all of this.

I have been working as an I.T. Administrator since 2003, and in that time I have picked up many skills. I have always rather envied the Developers though, as my interest in computers actually started writing basic on a TI994a back in the early 80s. ![TI994a](http://www.oldcomputers.net/pics/ti-994a.jpg)

Historically I have found that I could never wrap my head around modern OOP. I was always good at scripting and service automation, but looking at Ruby source code or opening a project in Android Studio gave me these little panic attacks. It made no damn sense to me at all! Why the hell am I putting XML code over here, and then Java over in that file, and then having to create an entirely new java and XML file for apparently no reason!

One day I was working on some scripts in Debian to automate a visit to a new client. I wanted to be able to quickly run some information gathering scans on the network while interviewing the project lead, in order to give me as much data as I could gather with as little interaction from me as I could. I run this Debian install on a VMWare Workstation VM and found the host interface to be fairly clunky. I also found that with Windows 10 rebooting for updates without user intervention I wanted a better way to control the state of the VMs I was running and turned to Autoit.

Autoit is an old favorite of mine for scripting. I can hammer out an automation or help program quickly, and compile it to an exe for deployment to users without teaching them how batch files work or anything, so I set about to create some software to automate suspending and running VMs depending on the time of day, or whether Windows wanted to pull some stunt.

As many people know, a simple project can turn ugly fast, and eventually this led me to create my first GUI program. It wasn't pretty. On top of the project taking on a life of it's own I found myself taking forever to bug fix, and spending most of my time on Stackoverflow copying and pasting code to fix problems without really knowing WHY I was doing it.

 At this point I decided it as time to just forget everything and start over. I started taking any free online courses I could find, trying to discover a course that would teach me not only basic coding skills, but proper code structure and programming methodologies. I started with a free course from [Stanford][stanford] which gave me some great information about not only the novice concepts that I had been missing but led me to start asking the right questions about where I was going to go as a Developer. Android Development has been an interest of mine for a while now, so I started poking around to find free courses and found the [Android Development for Beginners][udacity] course on Udacity.

 I am about half way through now and I love the little "Aha" moments I get whenever a hole is filled in my knowledge stack. There are so many little things I knew I didn't know, and yearned to find out, and the teachers in that course are fantastic at rolling out the material in a very digestable way.

 I suppose I have rambled enough for one day. I think I get how this markup thing works now, so I will sign off.

 Thanks for reading!
